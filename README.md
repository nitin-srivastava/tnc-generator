# T&C Generator App

## Setup and run the application 
## Setup and run the automated tests

### Required Ruby and Bundler versions
#### Ruby
This app has been developed and tested on Ruby version `3.0.1`.
But you can use any Ruby version `> 2.5`.

Use `rbenv` or `rvm` to install it. I prefer `rbenv` over `rvm`. You can check out, on how to install [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

#### Bundler
You must have bundler version `2.2.15`. Run the below command to install it.
```
$ gem install bundler:2.2.15
$ bundle install
```
Now the app is ready to run on your machine.


Hope you found the given instructions helpful.
